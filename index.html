            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems are used for developers or anyone that will be working on multiple files simultaneously. In the past, this was done by saving multiple files with different dates and file names. You can see how if you had hundreds of people working on these files it would get messy quick. Because this was an obvious issue. This lead to the development of version control systems (VCS). The way this technology works, is that there is one remote repository housing the files. Each member has access to them and can make changes at any time. After changes are made the files are added back to the repository.  This still isn’t a perfect system but a step in the right direction. Problems that still arise are unwanted overwrites and lost of data. In a well-developed VCS you can go back to any previous version of the file. Files are continuously being backed up and marked for changes. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In software development, distributed version control is a form of version control where the complete codebase, including its full history is mirrored on every developer's computer. This allows branching and merging to be managed automatically. This technique increases speeds of most operations (except for pushing and pulling), improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups. Some advantages to DVCS compared with centralized systems include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow users to work productively when not connected to a network.</li>
                <li>Working copies effectively function as remote backups, which avoids relying on one &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp physical machine as a single point of failure.</li>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The nice thing about GitHub and repositories is that you can go and download or "clone" someone’s repository and start working on code that a wide community all has access to. This makes it extremely easy for the community to work on open projects. Or even can use this as a tool for learning new languages. They have so much code ready for grabs to play around with. This idea is extraordinary and makes saving and sharing files a breeze. Knowing how to use a repository like Github looks good for employers. It shows you take your coding serious and they like to see that. All companies use a repository of this kind. It might not be exactly Github but it’ll be something very similar to it. I think Github is the leading VCS now, so it’s cool we get some experience with it in class. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The new system had goals to improve speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches fully distributed, able to handle large projects like the linux kernel efficiently (speed and data sizes). Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use. The major difference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data. Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.  Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots. This is an important distinction between Git and nearly all other VCSs. It makes Git reconsider almost every aspect of version control that most other systems copied from the previous generation. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it, rather than simply a VCS. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> One of the unique things about git is that it comes with a hand full of commands. These commands are inserted into the terminal. To help break these down I will explain them briefly. There are 3 commands you need to know for sure. I call this the starter pack. git push, pull, and merge. These are the most commonly used once you have your git repository set up. Now some commands you need to know to get started. git config to set up the repository, so here you will give it a name and some other details. Git init initiates your repository. Clone lets you make a copy of the repository. Git add allows you to add your work so then you can push when you’re ready to add to the remote repository. Git branch allows you to see what branch you currently on. Those are the most common commands you need to know to at least get started. Look over this list and get familiar with the other ones as well. Getting familiar with all of them will improve your chances to be a GitHub pro.</p>
